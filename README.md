Rule Engine For Maersk Interview

# Description
RulesEngine is a console application which needs to be run.
All other projects are class libraries.

## Running the code
On running you will need to choose a product and a payment method. The program will perform the necessary action.

## Note
In the interest of time, I have used a dummy database and no dependency injection.
Using these would create a better solution.
